# Werewolf

The game ultimate werewolf is played by alternating night and day. Each night, all players exexute the roles, given to them by their cards and and actions that they are required to do. The game moderator is responsible for the ordering of the players and the correct execution of the gameflow. In order to relieve him/her a little, this program helps with those things, announcing the waking order, the kills and the other actions.
